# Spec authoring rules

Writing rules for `specs/`. One file per document type. This tree is the only copy of those rules.

Specs and `_template` files keep a section skeleton and an authoring-rules link. They do not contain the rules. Filling a spec must not change files under this directory.

Before creating or editing a file under `specs/`, read the rules file for its path in the table below, then every file named in that rules file's **Also read** line. Follow the [`author-spec`](../../skills/author-spec/SKILL.md) skill. How these rules relate to the review checklists is [alignment.md](../alignment.md).

Spec depth (`prototype`, `small`, or `full`) is set in `specs/definition/definition.md`. [depth.md](depth.md) states how it scales story coverage, mockups, and diagrams. A rules file that says a requirement follows spec depth defers to it.

## Undecided aspects (TBD)

This rule applies to every spec. When an aspect is not decided yet, write `TBD — <open question>` where the decision belongs: a field value, a table cell, a list item, or a sentence. Do not invent the decision, and do not leave `<!-- fill in -->` in its place.

- One open question per TBD, phrased so the product owner can answer it. Name the options when known: `TBD — 2D or 3D?`.
- `TBD` is uppercase and reserved for this marker. A bare `TBD` with no question fails Spec lint.
- Keep the section skeleton. A whole section may be a single TBD line.
- A downstream spec does not build on a TBD. An aspect that depends on one is TBD too, and its question links the upstream spec.
- Code does not implement a TBD aspect.
- `<!-- fill in -->` means not yet captured. TBD means captured but undecided. `N/A — reason` means it does not apply.

Resolve TBDs with the `audit-spec-tbd` skill, then `author-spec`.

## Path table

Match the most specific path. A file split out from a spec uses the rules file of the spec it came from. For example, `specs/definition/quality/performance.md` uses [quality.md](quality.md), and `specs/design/glossary/combat.md` uses [design/glossary.md](design/glossary.md).

Do not paste these rules into a spec. Do not edit a `_template` file to hold one game's content. Copy the template, then fill the copy.

Review checklists stay beside this tree, in [`.agents/specs/`](../). They judge specs. They are not pasted into `specs/` either.
