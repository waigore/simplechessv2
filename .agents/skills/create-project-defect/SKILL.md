  Create a GitHub Defect issue (type:defect) from docs/issues/; wire related
  links when provided. Blocked-by is banned (hierarchy.md).
  Use when the user reports wrong game or interface behavior vs expected play.
  Do not use for specs, docs, story maps, AC hygiene, or planning gaps (those
  are tasks or clarification — see docs/issues/requirements.md).

  Examples:
  - user: "File a defect: jump input ignored on web" → collect per docs/issues/, create
  - user: "Defect related to #15" → related section only
  - user: "Draft defect body only" → --no-create

# Create project defect

Veneer for a repository **Defect** (`type:defect`). In-game or interface bugs only.

**Create:** read and apply [`typed-issue-create.md`](../create-project-task/references/typed-issue-create.md).

## Deltas

- **Before create:** if the report is a spec, design, doc, or planning problem, abort. Use clarification on an owning open issue, or `create-project-task` when the gap is material and uncovered.
- Collect optional reproduction, context, `related`, and `parent`. Do not collect or wire `blocked_by` / `blocking`.
- If `parent` is set, attach it as a sub-issue and enforce depth from `hierarchy.md`.
- Related-only issues stay in `## Related tasks or defects`.
- When `create-project-feedback` is the caller, set priority and any `Supersedes #N` line per [`feedback.md`](../../../docs/issues/feedback.md).
- Never file a defect for specs, docs, maps, or non-material hygiene ([`requirements.md`](../../../docs/issues/requirements.md) — When to file what).
