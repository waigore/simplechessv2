description: |-
  Create a GitHub Epic issue (type:epic) from docs/issues/. Blocked-by is
  banned (hierarchy.md).
  Use when the user asks for an epic, a broad orchestration outcome, or a parent for multiple tasks.
  Use proactively when planning work that should be split into linked tasks.

  Examples:
  - user: "Create an epic for player movement" → collect per docs/issues/, create, report URL
  - user: "Draft an epic body only" → --no-create, print markdown body
  - user: "Epic for audio" → create without blocked-by

# Create project epic

Veneer for a repository **Epic** (`type:epic`).

**Create:** read and apply [`typed-issue-create.md`](../create-project-task/references/typed-issue-create.md).

## Deltas

- Collect optional notes. Do not collect or wire `blocked_by` / `blocking`.
- Do not create child tasks unless asked. Use `create-project-task` for children.
- When `create-project-feedback` is the caller, set `priority:high` per [`feedback.md`](../../../docs/issues/feedback.md).
