  Establish or refresh a kind's Style series: bootstrap approved style
  anchors, create the modality binding (Recraft style for visual;
  ElevenLabs finetune for music, voice id for voice; soft anchors for
  SFX), write the kind registry (binding, prompt_policy, state active),
  and open a PR. Identity needs enforced styling, master/negative
  prompting, and review (look or listen). Recraft is required for
  visual series; ElevenLabs for music/SFX/voice (docs/asset-tools.md).
  Use when starting a kind's consistent generation, after anchors change,
  when the series is stale, or the user asks to create/refresh the style
  for sprites, tiles, music, SFX, or voice.

  Examples:
    - user: "Set up the character-sprite style series" → APR.establish-style (Recraft)
    - user: "Establish the battle-music finetune from these anchors" → music series
    - user: "Refresh the tile style after new anchors" → recreate binding, update SS1

# Establish asset style

Procedure: [`specs/assets/procedures/establish-style.md`](../../../specs/assets/procedures/establish-style.md) (`APR.establish-style`). Kind Style series: kind specs under [`specs/assets/kinds/`](../../../specs/assets/kinds/). Tools: [`docs/asset-tools.md`](../../../docs/asset-tools.md). Related: [`manage-asset`](../manage-asset/SKILL.md), [`review-asset`](../review-asset/SKILL.md).

## Steps

1. **Gate**. Stop and offer `author-spec` / `capture-requirements` when the kind Style series section or cited aesthetics hold TBD, or the modality MCP is unavailable and no person can run the binding step in the web app (Recraft `create_style`; ElevenLabs finetune / voice clone).
2. **Resolve** the kind spec and its `SS1` series. Confirm state, **modality** (`visual` | `music` | `sfx` | `voice`), and **enforce** (`hard` | `soft`).
3. **Bootstrap anchors** if `style_anchors` is empty or the user is replacing them:
   - Generate seeds with `manage-asset` using the **bootstrap** prompt template + `prompt_policy`, or register person-supplied assets with `register-asset`.
   - Require `review-asset` Pass (or person exemption). Confirm with the user which approved asset IDs are anchors. Set state `bootstrapping` until then.
4. **Create style binding** per modality (see `docs/asset-tools.md`):
   - **visual (hard)**: upload anchors; Recraft `create_style`; record `recraft_style_id` + model/base.
   - **music (hard)**: upload anchors; create Music Finetune; record `elevenlabs_finetune_id` + model; set Audio Reference policy (`required` | `optional` | `none`).
   - **voice (hard)**: clone or select voice from anchors; record `elevenlabs_voice_id`.
   - **sfx (soft)**: no product style id; keep anchors + `prompt_policy` only until a durable binding exists.
5. **Write the registry** in the kind Style series (`SS1`): modality, enforce, `style_anchors`, style binding, `built_from` (anchor IDs + `YYYY-MM-DD`), aesthetics cites, `prompt_policy` (compose, master, negative citing `PAL`/`FRM` or `SND.*` as applicable). Set state `active`.
6. **Refresh** when `stale`: recreate binding from current anchors; replace the hard id (never keep the old id silently) or reaffirm soft anchors. Note assets that need `APR.update` via `manage-asset`.
7. **PR** per [`docs/pull-requests.md`](../../../docs/pull-requests.md). Authority cites the kind Style series and aesthetics IDs. Test plan: anchors Pass, binding created (or soft affirmed), kind registry updated. If the work delivers a typed issue, run [`implement-project-issue`](../implement-project-issue/SKILL.md).

## Rules

- Recraft is required for visual establish and style-constrained generate. ElevenLabs is required for music / SFX / voice. Do not use fal as a substitute style-binding source.
- Do not invent anchors, prompt_policy clauses, or aesthetics IDs. Missing ones go to specs first.
- Three pillars: enforced styling, master/negative prompting, review (look or listen). Establishing style alone does not approve series members.
- Credentials never enter the repository.
