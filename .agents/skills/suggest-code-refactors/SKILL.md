  Review implementation code for structure and technical debt and file the
  refactor epics and tasks that judgement selects. Thin orchestrator over
  audit-code-structure, create-project-epic, and create-project-task. Does not
  edit the repo. Filing needs no second confirmation.
  Use when the user asks for a structure review, refactor suggestions, or a
  technical-debt pass over the implementation tree or a named portion.

  Examples:
    - user: "Where should we refactor?" → whole tree except demos/, file the cut
    - user: "Suggest refactors in src/combat" → that portion, file the cut
    - user: "Audit structure, don't file" → audit-code-structure only

# Suggest code refactors

Thin orchestrator. Audit with [`audit-code-structure`](../audit-code-structure/SKILL.md). File with [`create-project-epic`](../create-project-epic/SKILL.md) and [`create-project-task`](../create-project-task/SKILL.md). Do not restate them. Do not call [`review-code`](../review-code/SKILL.md).

## Steps

1. Run the audit. If the user asked not to file, or there are no findings, return the report and stop.
2. Skip a finding an open typed issue already covers.
3. File the cut. Invoking this skill is the ask; do not ask for confirmation.
4. Report the audit, filed URLs, skips, and anything left unfiled.

## Cut

Judge the cut. One task is one PR-sized change: group findings that belong together and split the rest. Create an epic in this run only when several of those tasks share one outcome, or use a parent the user named. Do not attach to an unrelated epic. Leave a finding unfiled when it is not worth a task and does not fold into one already in the cut.

A `needs decision` finding is a task to record the decision, not a prescribed code shape. If the target changes structure [`specs/technical/`](../../../specs/technical/technical.md) already specifies, include that spec update. Set blocked-by when one refactor must land first. Map evidence and the proposed target into the required sections. Tasks only.

## Rules

- Do not edit the repository.
- Honor issue hierarchy depth.
