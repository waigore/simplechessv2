# Status transitions (reference)

Contract: [`docs/issues/workflow.md`](../../../../docs/issues/workflow.md). Do not invent statuses or transitions.

## Valid `status:*` labels

`status:pending-review`, `status:pending-refinement`, `status:pending-clarification`, `status:pending-implementation`, `status:pending-verification`, `status:pending-acceptance`, `status:accepted`, `status:superseded`

Exactly one of these on each `type:epic` / `type:task` / `type:defect` issue.

## Allowed transitions

| From | To | Typical evidence |
|------|-----|------------------|
| pending-review | pending-implementation | Pass review comment (latest) |
| pending-review | pending-refinement | Fail review comment |
| pending-review | pending-clarification | Clarification questions comment |
| pending-refinement | pending-review | Refined body + summary comment |
| pending-clarification | pending-review | PO clarification comment |
| pending-clarification | pending-refinement | PO comment saying refine needed |
| pending-implementation | pending-verification | Implementation deliverables comment |
| pending-verification | pending-acceptance | Pass verification comment |
| pending-verification | pending-implementation | Fail verification comment |
| pending-acceptance | accepted | Accept comment with test evidence |
| pending-acceptance | pending-implementation | Fail accept (+ defect link) |
| pending-acceptance | pending-clarification | Needs PO clarification |
| pending-review, pending-refinement, pending-clarification, pending-implementation, pending-verification, pending-acceptance | superseded | Supersession comment naming the successor |

`accepted` and `superseded` are terminal: no transition leaves either. Closure is planner-only for both ([terminal-states.md](../../../../docs/issues/terminal-states.md)); this gate never closes an issue.

## Label swap (`gh`)

1. Read current labels: `gh issue view <n> --json labels --jq '.labels[].name'`
2. Collect every existing `status:*` label.
3. Remove them: `gh issue edit <n> --remove-label "status:…" …` (all current status labels).
4. Add target: `gh issue edit <n> --add-label "status:<target>"`.

Never close the issue when applying `status:accepted` or `status:superseded` (closure is planner-only).

Label swaps change labels only; body and comment writes follow [`docs/issues/body-writes.md`](../../../../docs/issues/body-writes.md).

## Gate mode inputs

Action skills pass: issue number, expected `from` status (short name without `status:` prefix or full label), desired `to` status. Abort if current status ≠ `from` (after normalizing). Apply swap only when the transition is in the table above.

## Fail-review cascade

When `review-project-issue` has authorized a cascade under [Cascade (fail review)](../../../../docs/issues/workflow-cascade.md), each authorized issue may be moved to `status:pending-refinement` from any current status (swap all `status:*` → `pending-refinement`). Expected `from` is that issue’s current status. The gate applies the swap; it does not re-decide authorization. This exception is only for that authorized cascade.

`project-planner-agent` may move an issue from `pending-refinement` back to the `status:*` it held before that cascade, or to `pending-review` when the prior label cannot be read, after commenting why the cascade doc does not still authorize it. The issue that failed review is not this edge. Other callers cannot use it.
