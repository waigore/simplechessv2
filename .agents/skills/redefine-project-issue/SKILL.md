  Replace a task/defect in status:pending-redefinition with a new task that
  states the unresolved problem succinctly, labeled pending-clarification;
  remap parent, comment supersession, close the old issue as not_planned.
  Blocked-by is banned — do not remirror edges. Called by
  project-planner-agent after the comment-cap lock. Keep this skill thin;
  linking follows create-project-task.

  Examples:
    - planner finds #42 pending-redefinition → new task, close #42
    - user: "Redefine the locked defect #17" → same flow (always a new task)

# Redefine project issue

Replace one open `type:task` or `type:defect` in `status:pending-redefinition` with a **new task**. Do not unlock the old conversation. Do not continue work on the locked issue.

**Contract:** [`docs/issues/workflow-comment-cap.md`](../../../docs/issues/workflow-comment-cap.md). **Body shape:** [`docs/issues/body-shapes.md`](../../../docs/issues/body-shapes.md) (Task). **Linking:** [`create-project-task/references/github-issue-linking.md`](../create-project-task/references/github-issue-linking.md).

## Steps

1. **Confirm** the target is open, `type:task` or `type:defect`, and `status:pending-redefinition`. Abort otherwise.
2. **Read** title, body, labels, parent (sub-issue), and priority. Distill the **unresolved problem** into a short Description — no thread replay. Do not remirror native blocked-by ([`hierarchy.md`](../../../docs/issues/hierarchy.md)).
3. **Create** a Task via the linking reference:
   - Labels: `type:task`, `status:pending-clarification` (not `pending-review`), same `priority:*` as the old issue (default `priority:normal` if unlabeled).
   - Body: required Task sections only; Deliverables / AC may say clarification needed. Note `Supersedes #OLD`. No `## Dependencies` / blocked-by lines.
   - Attach the same parent when the old issue had one (depth check still applies).
4. **Comment** on the old issue: `Superseded by #NEW` (write access may still comment while locked).
5. **Close** the old issue: `gh issue close OLD --reason not_planned`. Do not unlock.
6. **Report** old URL (closed), new URL (`pending-clarification`), and parent.

## Rules

- Always create a **task**, even when the old issue was a defect.
- If feedback already superseded and closed the issue, stop ([`feedback.md`](../../../docs/issues/feedback.md)).
- Do not unlock. Do not gate-transition `pending-redefinition` via `enforce-task-workflow-status`.
- Keep the new body succinct; clarification is the next step.
- Caller: [`project-planner-agent`](../project-planner-agent/SKILL.md).
