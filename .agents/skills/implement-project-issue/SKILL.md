  After implementing an epic/task/defect in status:pending-implementation, post a
  deliverables summary (PRs/commits) and move to pending-verification.
  Use when implementation work for an issue is done and ready for verification.

  Examples:
    - user: "Mark #12 implemented; PR #40" → summary comment + gate status
    - user: "Implementation done for the HUD task" → same for that issue

# Implement project issue

Record implementation evidence for a typed issue in `status:pending-implementation`.

**Contract:** [`docs/issues/workflow.md`](../../../docs/issues/workflow.md)

**Evidence writes:** [`docs/issues/body-writes.md`](../../../docs/issues/body-writes.md) — guarded writer `gh_issue.py`, read-back.

**Status gate:** [`enforce-task-workflow-status`](../enforce-task-workflow-status/SKILL.md)

## Steps

1. **Load** issue `n` (requirements, deliverables, acceptance criteria).
2. **Assert** `status:pending-implementation`.
3. **Main-tree UI gate** ([`docs/ux-mockups.md`](../../../docs/ux-mockups.md)): if deliverables include main-tree UI for a screen, that screen's row in [`specs/ux/mockups/catalog.md`](../../../specs/ux/mockups/catalog.md) must be `approved`. If not, stop — do not gate to verification; comment the missing approval (and unapprove/`draft` if a material upstream change landed after review). PoCs under `pocs/` are exempt.
4. **Confirm** deliverables exist (PRs, commits, paths). Ask if missing.
5. **Comment** summarizing what was created or modified against the issue requirements; include PR/commit links.
6. **Gate** via `enforce-task-workflow-status`: `pending-implementation` → `pending-verification`.
7. **Report** URL, evidence comment, and new status.

## Rules

- This skill records evidence and status; it does not replace doing the implementation work.
- Call `enforce-task-workflow-status` for the label change.
- Do not treat journey catalog approval as required to implement a screen; the **screen** row is the gate.
