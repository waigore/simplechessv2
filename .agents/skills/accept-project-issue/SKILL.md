  Accept, fail, or escalate clarification for an epic/task/defect in
  status:pending-acceptance using test evidence against acceptance criteria.
  Cite the deterministic rubric record. When an Applies llm-judge axis can
  move, run run-quality-evaluators.
  Use when running acceptance testing after verification.

  Examples:
    - user: "Accept #12 with evidence in docs/playtest/evidence/... and wiki URL" → accept comment, status:accepted, leave open (planner may close later)
    - user: "Acceptance failed; file defect" → create defect (game/interface only), link, → pending-implementation
    - user: "Need PO input to finish acceptance on #12" → pending-clarification
    - user: "Headless accept on #12; screenshots still waiting" → stay pending-acceptance, no defect

# Accept project issue

Veneer over the [action shell](../enforce-task-workflow-status/references/action-shell.md) for `status:pending-acceptance`.

**Type routing:** [`docs/issues/requirements.md`](../../../docs/issues/requirements.md) (When to file what).

**Playtesting:** [`specs/playtest/playtest.md`](../../../specs/playtest/playtest.md) — required only when deliverables change playable behavior. Wiki media: [`docs/playtest/wiki-evidence.md`](../../../docs/playtest/wiki-evidence.md).

**Quality evaluators:** [`run-quality-evaluators`](../run-quality-evaluators/SKILL.md) — `llm-judge` when an Applies qualitative axis can move. Deterministic reuse: [`docs/quality/evidence/README.md`](../../../docs/quality/evidence/README.md). Do not run `deterministic` here.

Load acceptance criteria, the verification comment, and related PRs. Test against each acceptance criterion. Evidence must be locatable: in-repo paths for the playtest index and quality records; wiki page URL for playtest screenshots and logs. Summarize where to find it.

When the issue's deliverables change playable behavior (game or code), also run AI-agent playtesting per [`specs/playtest/playtest.md`](../../../specs/playtest/playtest.md). Cite the in-repo run under [`docs/playtest/evidence/`](../../../docs/playtest/evidence/) (`manifest.md`, notes, story IDs, pass or fail) and the **wiki page URL** for logs and screenshots when required. Spec-only, docs-only, or other non-playable deliverables do not require playtesting.

A headless playtest run may judge and record pass or fail, notes, and logs. Acceptance still needs screenshots from a graphical re-run of that same build on the wiki for every protocol that requires them. A protocol that says none may be accepted from the headless run alone.

When the deliverable can move an Applies deterministic axis, cite the passing `deterministic` record that covers this `game/` tree. Do not run that mode here. A **fail** or **blocked** row is an acceptance Fail. No covering record: stay on `pending-acceptance` (see Outcome).

When the deliverable can move an Applies `llm-judge` axis, run [`run-quality-evaluators`](../run-quality-evaluators/SKILL.md) in `llm-judge` mode. Include its report and the evidence path. A **fail** row is an acceptance Fail. **blocked** / `missing-evidence` stays on `pending-acceptance`. **blocked** / `missing-judge-record` is Clarify. **N/A** from that skill adds no rubric evidence.

## Outcome

- **Accept** — comment summarizing evidence per criterion and related PRs, including the in-repo playtest manifest path and wiki page URL (with graphical-run screenshots) when playtesting required them, the deterministic evidence path when a deterministic axis applies, and the llm-judge evidence path when a qualitative axis applies. Gate: `pending-acceptance` → `accepted`. Leave the issue open. Only [`project-planner-agent`](../project-planner-agent/SKILL.md) closes accepted work.
- **Waiting on screenshots** — headless judgement is recorded and required screenshots are not on the wiki page yet. Comment with the in-repo evidence path, wiki page URL if any, and that acceptance waits on a graphical re-run of the same build. Stay on `pending-acceptance`. Do not file a defect. Do not call the status gate.
- **Waiting on deterministic record** — an Applies deterministic axis can move and no passing `deterministic` record covers this `game/` tree. Comment that acceptance waits on that record. Verification supplies it. Stay on `pending-acceptance`. Do not run those checks in this skill. Do not file a defect. Do not call the status gate.
- **Waiting on judge evidence** — an `llm-judge` row is **blocked** / `missing-evidence`. Comment with the axis id and the evidence the judge record allows. Stay on `pending-acceptance`. Do not file a defect. Do not call the status gate.
- **Fail** — a protocol failed for a **game or interface** reason, a deterministic record row is **fail** or **blocked**, or an `llm-judge` row is **fail**. Create a Defect via `create-project-defect` when the miss is game or interface behavior, and link it in the comment. Gate: `pending-acceptance` → `pending-implementation`. Missing screenshots, a missing deterministic record, or missing judge evidence alone are not this outcome. Never file a defect for a spec, doc, or map problem.
- **Clarify** — tests cannot proceed without product-owner input, a wrong or ambiguous **spec** blocks judging the acceptance criteria, or an `llm-judge` row is **blocked** / `missing-judge-record`. Summarize questions. The axis stays as written. Gate: `pending-acceptance` → `pending-clarification`. No defect.
