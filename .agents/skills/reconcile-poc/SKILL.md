description: |-
  Optional reconcile act for a PoC before promoting learning into specs/main.
  Walk claims, ask keep/drop/adapt, resolve conflicts into specs, record the act
  in the PoC README. Does not block unrelated main-code work.
  Use when the user asks to promote or reconcile a PoC, or a task requires it.

  Examples:
    - user: "Promote the rendering PoC" → walk claims, resolve conflicts, record act
    - user: "Reconcile pocs we have" → incomplete acts only

# Reconcile PoC

Contract: [`docs/poc-promotion.md`](../../../docs/poc-promotion.md). Apply the Act. Do not restate it.

## Steps

1. **Setup**: run [`ensure-project-setup`](../ensure-project-setup/SKILL.md) unless it already passed in this session. Continue only on Pass.
2. **Select**: the PoC(s) the user named, or every incomplete act under `pocs/` if they asked to reconcile all. If none exist, stop and say so—do **not** block main-code work.
3. **Already satisfied**: if every selected act is complete and no kept claim disagrees with another kept claim or the current spec, return pass. Do not walk a completed act again.
4. **Walk**: for each incomplete PoC, for each claim/behavior, ask keep, drop, or adapt. Default keep. Wait for that item before the next.
5. **Conflicts**: among kept/adapted claims, and vs the current spec, stop at each disagreement and ask. Write the winner with [`audit-spec-tbd`](../audit-spec-tbd/SKILL.md) or [`author-spec`](../author-spec/SKILL.md). Open a spec PR per [Spec PRs](../../../docs/pull-requests.md#spec-prs). Drop or adapt the losing claim. Leave PoC behavior unchanged.
6. **Merge**: if a spec PR from this act is open, the act is not complete. Say so and stop.
7. **Record**: write each PoC's Promotion act table and mark complete. Do not otherwise edit the PoC.
8. **Hand off**: for each non-empty keep/adapt list, reimplementation is [`promote-poc`](../promote-poc/SKILL.md). An empty list does not start it. Return pass when every selected act is complete.

## Rules

- Requirement notes are not authority.
- Do not reimplement PoC code here.
- Do not edit main code here.
- Do not require a PoC to exist before unrelated main-tree work.
