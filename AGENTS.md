# AGENTS.md

Agent entrypoint for this repo. Keep this file short; put detail in `docs/`, `specs/`, and `.agents/`.

## Project

- **Purpose**: Zen web chess — same-device two-player games and an adaptive solo puzzle stream, set at a cafe table ([`specs/vision.md`](specs/vision.md)).
- **Language / engine**: Godot 4.7.2 + GDScript (2D web / touch) — [`specs/definition/definition.md`](specs/definition/definition.md); [ADR-0001](specs/adr/decisions/0001-godot-engine.md).
- **Frameworks / tools**: Godot web export; optional Stockfish advice via backend ([ADR-0002](specs/adr/decisions/0002-stockfish-advice-backend.md)); dual playtest environments ([ADR-0004](specs/adr/decisions/0004-dual-playtest-environments.md)); asset catalog `asset_catalog/` + files `game_assets/` ([ADR-0005](specs/adr/decisions/0005-asset-catalog-roots.md)); GitHub Actions CI (`Spec lint`, `Code lint`, label sync).

## Quick start commands

- **Setup**: Install Godot 4.7.2. Clone this repo; no installable package yet.
- **Run**: Open the Godot project under `game/` and run (or export to web). Full scene scaffold TBD.
- **Test**: TBD — coding conventions / technical specs.
- **Build / export**: Godot HTML5/web export for the browser (ADR-0001).

## Labels

Issue labels for categorization and agent orchestration. Source of truth: `.github/project-labels.yml`. Details: [`docs/labels.md`](docs/labels.md).

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `type:epic` | Broad orchestration epic |
| `type:task` | Concrete unit of agent work |
| `type:defect` | Bug/problem with any deliverable (code, game, spec, etc.) |
| `status:*` | Workflow state (see [`docs/issues/workflow.md`](docs/issues/workflow.md)) |
| `no-automerge` | PR label: opt out of automatic squash-merge (user-requested only) |

Synced by `.github/workflows/sync-labels.yml` (push to `main` when label config changes, or `workflow_dispatch`). Add labels with the `create-project-label` skill.

## Issues

Epic / Task / Defect forms live in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Agents create issues with the matching `create-project-*` skill (sub-issues + native blocked-by). Contract: [`docs/issues/`](docs/issues/). Status workflow: [`docs/issues/workflow.md`](docs/issues/workflow.md).

## Skills

Canonical skills and catalog: [`.agents/`](.agents/) ([README](.agents/README.md)). Authoring and native facades: [`docs/skills.md`](docs/skills.md). MCP setup (add / enable / test; no credentials in-repo): `setup-project-mcp` — [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md).

Open Design (user-local, not in this repo): install/verify with `ensure-open-design-skill-setup` — wrapper `~/.open-design-skill/skill`, content `~/.open-design-skill/repo` (or `OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT`); optional symlinks under `~/.cursor/skills/open-design`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/open-design`, `~/.grok/skills/open-design`. Contract: [`docs/open-design-skill-setup.md`](docs/open-design-skill-setup.md).

## Rules to live by

**Before any work, read [`.agents/rules.md`](.agents/rules.md)**: secondary rules for spec authoring, depth, and review; ADRs; playtesting; aesthetics and assets; technical design; concise docs; and demos.

- **Template setup and updates**: in a new repo from this template, run `ensure-project-setup` before any other work or PR ([`docs/github-repo-setup.md`](docs/github-repo-setup.md)). Pull upstream template changes with `sync-upstream-template`; never merge upstream by hand.
- **High-level requirements first**: `capture-requirements` locks in vision, definition, and quality before any downstream spec is captured; earlier design-level detail waits in [`docs/requirements/`](docs/requirements/README.md) (notes, not specs).
- **Small PRs only**: `main` is protected; changes land via PR only. When a change is done, branch (`<type>/<issue#>-<slug>`), push, and open a PR using the template; link issues with `Refs #n`, never `Closes`. Keep PRs focused and testable, under ~30 files; split if larger. PRs auto-merge on green; use draft while incomplete; apply `no-automerge` only if the user asks. Contract: [`docs/pull-requests.md`](docs/pull-requests.md).
- **Spec first**: if it is not in `specs/`, it must not be in the code. Undecided aspects are marked `TBD — <question>` in any spec ([rule](.agents/specs/rules/README.md#undecided-aspects-tbd)) and are not coded; resolve them with `audit-spec-tbd`.
- **SOLID code**: follow [`docs/solid.md`](docs/solid.md) (template-owned, all projects) and [`docs/coding-conventions.md`](docs/coding-conventions.md) (project-owned; extends SOLID, never contradicts it). Review with `review-code` (also run from `verify-project-issue` when a PR has code changes).

---

**Maintaining this file:** When forking or starting a project from this template, fill in every `<!-- fill in -->` with real project details once the specs they come from exist (purpose from the vision, engine from the definition). Keep "Rules to live by" at five rules; add any other rule to [`.agents/rules.md`](.agents/rules.md). Keep each section to a few lines; link out to `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.agents/` for anything longer.
