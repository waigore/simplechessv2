# Playtesting

Authoring rules: [`.agents/specs/rules/playtest/playtest.md`](../../.agents/specs/rules/playtest/playtest.md).

## Purpose

AI-agent playtesting proves the running build against game design and UX. It is not a unit or integration test plan (see `specs/technical/verification.md`). View stories are out of scope.

## Levels

| Level | Proves | Cites |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Design | Game behaves and feels as designed | Design story / element IDs |
| UX | Actors can operate the interface as specified | UX story / journey IDs |

## Coverage

- **Mode**: <!-- fill in: full | critical-only -->
- **Critical IDs**: see [`coverage.md`](coverage.md)

## Gate

Required at `status:pending-acceptance` (`accept-project-issue`) when the issue's deliverables change playable behavior (game or code). Not required for spec-only, docs-only, or other non-playable deliverables.

## Evidence

Root: [`docs/playtest/evidence/`](../../docs/playtest/evidence/). Each required run records story IDs, pass/fail, screenshots, notes, and logs. Schema: [`evidence.md`](evidence.md).

## Architecture constraints

| Kind | Capability | Playtest need |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Must | Debug UI | Agent can inspect and control play state while running protocols |
| Must | Telemetry events | Agent can correlate observations to story IDs and outcomes |
| Situational | Seed, replay, state dump — see [`tools.md`](tools.md) | When a protocol requires them |

ADRs and technical design (including verification seams) must satisfy Must rows. Situational rows apply only when a protocol needs them. Detail: [`tools.md`](tools.md).

## Traceability

[`traceability.md`](traceability.md).
