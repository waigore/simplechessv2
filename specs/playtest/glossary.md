| Design playtest | An agent protocol that proves the build against a design story or element. | [`design/`](design/) |
| Evidence run | One issue/run folder under `docs/playtest/evidence/` with manifest, notes, and logs, plus screenshots when a graphical run has captured them. | [`evidence.md`](evidence.md) |
| Graphical run | A playtest session with a display that re-runs the protocols and captures screenshots of the judged state for the same build. | [`evidence.md`](evidence.md), [`procedures.md`](procedures.md) |
| Headless run | A playtest session with no display. It may judge protocols and record pass/fail, notes, and logs. Missing screenshots are not a protocol fail. | [`evidence.md`](evidence.md), [`procedures.md`](procedures.md) |
| Manifest | The `manifest.md` index of story results and artifact paths for an evidence run. | [`evidence.md`](evidence.md) |
