# `specs/`

Product and technical specifications: what to build. Process docs live in [`docs/`](../docs/).

If it is not in `specs/`, it must not be in the code. Do not read [`adr/archive/`](adr/archive/README.md) unless explicitly asked.

## Concise specs

Every Markdown file under `specs/` stays under **500 words**; split and link if longer. CI enforces this (`word-limit` in [Spec lint](../docs/spec-lint.md)). HTML mockups and diagrams are exempt.

## Authoring

Read the matching rules file in [`.agents/specs/rules/`](../.agents/specs/rules/README.md) before editing a spec (`author-spec` skill). Reviews follow [`.agents/specs/alignment.md`](../.agents/specs/alignment.md). CI checks the mechanical rules ([`docs/spec-lint.md`](../docs/spec-lint.md)).

## Index

Add a row for each new spec file. Each hub indexes its own unit specs; its rules file says what it contains.
