description: |-
  Ensure local game-stack and asset tools from Accepted ADRs are installed and
  working. Use only when the user asks to set up or verify the dev environment;
  invent install/verify steps and transitive deps; best-effort install then report.
  Do not run as a gate for other skills.

  Examples:
    - user: "Set up my dev environment" → inventory, install, verify, report
    - user: "Are Godot and the asset tools installed?" → inventory, install gaps, report
    - user: "Ensure engine toolchain works" → same workflow

# Ensure dev env setup (facade)

Canonical instructions: [`.agents/skills/ensure-dev-env-setup/SKILL.md`](../../../.agents/skills/ensure-dev-env-setup/SKILL.md).

Read that file and its `references/` as needed, then run the workflow there. Do not invent a parallel process.
