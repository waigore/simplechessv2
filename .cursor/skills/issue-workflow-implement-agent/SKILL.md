  Background dispatch for status:pending-implementation: resolve or discover one
  typed issue, perform the implementation work, then run implement-project-issue
  (deliverables comment + status gate). Use when automation dispatches an
  unattended implement agent.

  Examples:
    - dispatch with no issue → discover pending-implementation, pick one, implement
    - dispatch with #12 → implement #12, then implement-project-issue

# Issue workflow implement agent (facade)

Canonical instructions: [`.agents/skills/issue-workflow-implement-agent/SKILL.md`](../../../.agents/skills/issue-workflow-implement-agent/SKILL.md).

Read that file and its `references/` as needed, then run the workflow there. Do not invent a parallel process.
