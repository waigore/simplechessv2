# Background dispatch agents

Automation entrypoints for unattended runs of the [issue workflow](workflow.md). Humans keep calling `*-project-issue` directly. Each agent handles **one** issue per run — do not drain the queue.

| Agent | Status filter | Delegates to |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| `issue-workflow-review-agent` | `status:pending-review` | `review-project-issue` |
| `issue-workflow-refine-agent` | `status:pending-refinement` | `refine-project-issue` |
| `issue-workflow-clarify-agent` | `status:pending-clarification` | `clarify-project-issue` |
| `issue-workflow-implement-agent` | `status:pending-implementation` | do the work, then `implement-project-issue` |
| `issue-workflow-verify-agent` | `status:pending-verification` | `verify-project-issue` |
| `issue-workflow-accept-agent` | `status:pending-acceptance` | `accept-project-issue` |

No agent for `status:accepted` or `status:superseded` (both terminal; dispatch skips them). Closure of either is planner-only ([terminal-states.md](terminal-states.md)). No agent for `status:pending-redefinition` — planner via [workflow-comment-cap.md](workflow-comment-cap.md).

## Resolve the target issue

1. If `#n` is provided, use it (the underlying skill asserts the expected status). In an agent-orc prompt, `Assigned issue: N` is `#n` when N is a number. `Assigned issue: none` means this step did not receive an issue.
2. Otherwise discover candidates: open issues with a type label (`type:epic`, `type:task`, or `type:defect`) and the agent's status filter.
3. Pick **one** using **priority first, then judgement**:
   1. **Priority tier** (hard): `priority:critical`, then `priority:high`, then `priority:normal` / unlabeled (unlabeled counts as normal). If more than one `priority:*` is present, use the highest tier and leave hygiene to `enforce-task-workflow-status`.
   2. **Within the same tier**, pick by judgement (not a rigid sort). Soft preferences, which an unblocker or foundational issue can outweigh: defects over tasks, and tasks over epics; an earlier wave over a later one. A wave is the issue’s milestone titled `Wave N — …` ([waves.md](waves.md)). When type and wave disagree, or the issue has no wave milestone, judge — do not invent a wave rank; the type preference still applies in general. Also prefer high-impact work — bottlenecks that unblock others (judge fan-out and how much dependents matter — not a raw count), foundational work, and issues that move the project most. Prefer issues that are themselves unblocked and ready to advance; prefer a leaf over its parent when both are eligible; age can break near-ties. Skip issues that clearly need human-only input you do not have (e.g. PO clarification with no answer in context).
4. Read and run the mapped `*-project-issue` skill for that issue. Do not invent parallel statuses, evidence formats, or transition rules.

Agents must not set or change `priority:*` labels (humans only), except hygiene via `enforce-task-workflow-status` when duplicates exist.

Trivial `[orc-e2e]` probe issues may use a minimal PR or doc touch as the implement deliverable.

Priority catalog: [`docs/labels.md`](../labels.md). The orchestrator claim list is a parallel lock, not this judgement: priority tier, then defect → task → epic, then earlier `Wave N`, then issue number. No `Wave N` milestone sorts after numbered waves. Discovering with `Assigned issue: none` still judges. Script and config: [`.orc/scripts/list-status-issues.sh`](../../.orc/scripts/list-status-issues.sh), [`agent-orc/docs/config.md`](../../agent-orc/docs/config.md).
