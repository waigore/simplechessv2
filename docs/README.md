# `docs/`

Project and process documentation (labels, issues, skills, repo setup). Product/technical specifications live in [`specs/`](../specs/).

## Concise docs

Every file under `docs/` must stay under **500 words**. If content would exceed that, split into multiple focused files and link between them. CI enforces this for Markdown (`word-limit` in [Spec lint](spec-lint.md)); run `python3 .github/scripts/spec_lint.py` locally.
