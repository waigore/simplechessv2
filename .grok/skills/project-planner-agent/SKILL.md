description: |-
  Align the GitHub issue plan with specs/ while shrinking open typed issues:
  own gaps on existing epics/tasks/defects, close accepted/superseded work, unblock,
  remove unwarranted review-fail cascades, dedup/combine; create only when
  necessary. Read the repo; never edit it.
  High autonomy on issue-domain changes.

  Examples:
    - user: "Plan against the specs" → breadth or depth; shrink/reattach before create
    - user: "Is wave 2 covered?" → depth on that tree; fix ownership in place
    - user: "What's specified but not planned?" → attach to owners; create only if none

# Project planner agent (facade)

Canonical instructions: [`.agents/skills/project-planner-agent/SKILL.md`](../../../.agents/skills/project-planner-agent/SKILL.md).

Read that file and its `references/` as needed, then run the workflow there. Do not invent a parallel process.
